# Investigating Resonance in Chua's Circuit System 

The present project explores various input signals capable of inducing resonance on the Chua's Circuit system. Specifically, what are the possible external signals capable of inducing a maximum amplitude response in the Chua's Circuit system?

The path to the answer is divided into three sections:

1) The theory underlying resonance are reviewed using Mathematica as computational environment. 
2) The range of resonant responses by the Chua's Circuit under various input signals are analysized using LTSpice as circuit simulation software. 
3) A PCB circuit is design using Eagle software and manufactured using standard lithography techniques. Experimental data are gathered using a signal generator as input and an oscilloscope to gather the response of the circuit. 

Further details about the experimental procedures can be found below:
