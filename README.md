# Investigating Non-Linear Resonance in the Chua's Circuit System 

The present research project explores various input signals capable of inducing non-linear resonance in the Chua's Circuit system. 

Specifically -->  What are the input signals capable of inducing a maximum amplitude response in the Chua's Circuit?

The path to the answer is divided into three sections:

1) Reviewing the theory underlying rnon-linear resonance using Mathematica as computational environment. 

2) Simulating the range of resonant responses by the Chua's Circuit under various input signals with LTSpice circuit simulation software. 

3) Designing the circuit using Eagle software and manufacturing the PCB using standard litography techniques. Gathering experimental data using a signal generator to generate the input signals paired with an oscilloscope to measure the response of the circuit.
